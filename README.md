What is ShitDE?

ShitDE is something I made because I was bored. I was supposed to play Among Us! with friends but only like 5 people showed up so we got bored and I ended up doing this.

What does ShitDE mean?

ShitDE means Shit Development Environment, because I can't be asked to come up with a name for something as shitty as this.
